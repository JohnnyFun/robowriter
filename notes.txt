- transform font to svg paths that axidraw can follow
  - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7742148/how-to-convert-text-to-svg-paths


- UI
  - svelte!
  - simple WYSIWYG editor with just a font-size picker
    - tabs translate to spaces...
  - print preview (more for debugging)
    - show svg output, ability to view svg and svg paths code
    - use simulator to show what will happen
  - configure settings
    - ability to tweak settings that make sense from UI...or at least a config json file

- Architecture
  - web app separate from the printer
  - printer plugin polymorphism
    - implement with simulator and real machine, be able to easily print to either

- Tests
  - cypress happy path
    - open home page
    - type into box
    - set font-size bigger
    - assert the svg that is generated is EXACTLY correct that will be sent to axidraw
      - put svg in hidden element 
  - cypress tests for WYSIWYG editor  
    - assert various inputs result in correct svg path output
      - tab translates to 2 spaces
      - capitalized letters, lowercase
      - line breaks work correctly with big or small font-sizes
