  placeholderLetter: `Hi there!

  I made you a package! It has treats for you to put in your mouth, taste, and swallow.
Don't eat too many treats though.

Here's another paragraph. Each character is an SVG path, so the axidraw machine will 
be able to consume it and regurgitate it onto paper.

Still some work to do to make sure spacing, line height, etc look decent, but this should
do the trick!

Sincerely,

- John`
